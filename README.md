This minor project, titled "Line Following Robot Using Arduino Uno," demonstrates the development of an autonomous robot capable of following a predefined path marked by a contrasting line on a surface. The robot also features obstacle detection and a mechanism to return to its initial position upon delivery of medicine.

Features

Line Following: Utilizes IR sensors to detect and follow a black line on a contrasting surface.

Obstacle Detection: IR sensors detect obstacles in the robot's path, enabling it to avoid collisions.

Return to Initial Position: Reed switch detects the removal of medicine, triggering the robot to return to its starting point.
